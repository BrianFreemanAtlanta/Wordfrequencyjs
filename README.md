# Wordfrequencyjs README

Visual Studio Extension to provide word frequency count for code

# Inspiration
This project is inspired by the fluentcpp blog by Jonathan Boccara 
[3 Things That Counting Words Can Reveal on Your Code](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/10/09/3-things-that-counting-words-can-reveal-on-your-code/)

## Features

This extension will analyze the section of designated section of code and provide statistics for the frequency of words appearing and also their span (difference from first to last line the word appears on.)

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:
- We will need an screenshot of the selection & output (gif?)
\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

There are no dependencies or prerequisites to install/run
If add coloring will need to add that extension as dependency.
